__Data__

The directories in this repository contain the following data:
1. __00 Image Examples:__ contains example images from different experiments.
2. __01 Time Series Data:__ contains time series of floc size distribution statistics (by volume), such as D50, moving towards an equilibrium value through net growth or net breakup.
3. __02 Equilibrium Data:__ contains floc size statistics once the distribution has reached a steady state condition.

Each folder also contains the pertinent metadata for the associated files in that directory.
